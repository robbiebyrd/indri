# Indri Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the Indri project.
Each task is specific, actionable, and organized by category. Check off tasks as they are completed.

## Architecture

2. [ ] Create a clear separation between domain models and database models
3. [ ] Implement a dependency injection pattern to improve testability
4. [ ] Refactor the monitorChanges function in boot.go to avoid hardcoded game IDs
5. [ ] Implement a proper logging framework with configurable log levels
6. [ ] Create a middleware system for HTTP and WebSocket request processing
7. [ ] Implement a more robust authentication and authorization system
8. [ ] Develop a clear API versioning strategy

## Code Quality

9. [ ] Add comprehensive code documentation following Go best practices
10. [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns across all packages
11. [ ] Refactor large functions (like those in boot.go) into smaller, more focused functions
12. [ ] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
13. [ ] Remove any unused code and dependencies
14. [ ] Add proper validation for all user inputs
15. [ ] Implement consistent logging throughout the application
16. [ ] Add context propagation for proper request cancellation

## Testing

17. [ ] Implement unit tests for all packages with a target of at least 80% code coverage
18. [ ] Create integration tests for database interactions
19. [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
20. [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
21. [ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical functions
22. [ ] Implement API tests for all endpoints
23. [ ] Create mock implementations for external dependencies to facilitate testing

## Configuration and Deployment

24. [ ] Align environment variable names in code with those in .env.example
25. [ ] Implement proper validation for environment variables
26. [ ] Update Dockerfile to use multi-stage builds for smaller images
27. [ ] Add health check endpoints for monitoring
28. [ ] Include the application service in docker-compose.yml
29. [ ] Implement graceful shutdown for the application
30. [ ] Add proper container security measures (non-root user, read-only filesystem)
31. [ ] Create deployment documentation for various environments

## Documentation

32. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
33. [ ] Document the application architecture and design decisions
